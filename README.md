This is a Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design study project.

## Concepts

- **Clean Architecture**: A software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and scale.
- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**: A design approach that focuses on modeling the core business domain and its logic.
- ***TDD (Test-Driven Development)***: A software development process where tests are written before the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements.
