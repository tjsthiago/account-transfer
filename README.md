This is a Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design study project.

## Concepts

- **Clean Architecture**: A software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns, making the system easier to maintain and scale.
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**: An architectural pattern that separates the core logic of an application from its external dependencies, allowing for easier testing and flexibility.
- ***Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)***: A principle stating that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**: A design approach that focuses on modeling the core business domain and its logic.
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: A software development process where tests are written before the actual code, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements.
